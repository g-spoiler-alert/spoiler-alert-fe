        <h2>Problem:</h2>
        <p>Tons of food goes bad from forgetting about the expiration date which is both wasteful and expensive. There isn't a great way to keep track of all of these expiration dates.</p>
        <h2>Our Solution:</h2>
        <p>The project will solve this problem by allowing users to input the contents of their pantries, fridges, and freezers along with their respective expiration dates into the app. The app will then allow a user to see their food items sorted by expiration date. This will make it easy to see what food to use first in the pantry.</p>
